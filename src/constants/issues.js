Blame it on bureaucrats, administrators, lawyers, insurers, coupled with inoperable EHRs (not designed by doctors), along with little clerical support, it all adds to the growing mass of required paperwork. Skeletal Man is here to save the day, selflessly slashing Red Tape and prioritizing patients over paperwork.',

Repealing this board — which was charged with making recommendations to cut Medicare expenditures if spending growth reached a certain level — has remained a top priority for AAOS over the years. Hundreds of orthopaedic surgeons visited Capitol Hill and/or talked to their elected representatives about this issue, and our legislative and political OGR team educated and whipped support for repeal over an eight-year course. It was a hot topic at the National Orthopaedic Leadership Conference (NOLC) as well as the subject of grassroots efforts that many of you supported. IPAB repeal is a shining example of what we can do when we bring our advocacy efforts together.`,
