    tagline: 'Skeletal Man vs Red Tape Mummy',
    intro: 'At a time when it often feels like paperwork is paramount to patient care, physicians can find themselves spending 50% of their time on paperwork. Blame it on bureaucrats, administrators, lawyers, insurers, coupled with inoperable EHRs (not designed by doctors), along with little clerical support, it all adds to the growing mass of required paperwork. Skeletal Man is here to save the day, selflessly slashing Red Tape and prioritizing patients over paperwork.',

As we find the state of health care in uncharted waters, there has never been a more pivotal time for us, as physicians, to be at the helm of the debate.

        headline: `Repeal the IPAB`,
        content: `Of AAOS’s many wins in the 115th legislative session, none are more notable than the repeal of the independent payment advisory board (IPAB). Repealing this board — which was charged with making recommendations to cut Medicare expenditures if spending growth reached a certain level — has remained a top priority for AAOS over the years. Hundreds of orthopaedic surgeons visited Capitol Hill and/or talked to their elected representatives about this issue, and our legislative and political OGR team educated and whipped support for repeal over an eight-year course. It was a hot topic at the National Orthopaedic Leadership Conference (NOLC) as well as the subject of grassroots efforts that many of you supported. IPAB repeal is a shining example of what we can do when we bring our advocacy efforts together.`,
